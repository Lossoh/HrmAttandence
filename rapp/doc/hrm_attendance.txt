    REST API
        Disc...
            GeoInTime is a single page application so a frontend uses REST API to connect with a backend. All operations you perform using UI, you can implement via API calls using your programing language. You can learn how API works if you trace what's going in the network tab in your browser console.
            Most of api functions return JSON. POST, PATCH calls usually need some JSON data in payload.
            Base URL of GeoInTime API is: api/v1/. You need to prepend it to expressions in this reference. Example:
            GET http://your_domain/api/v1/Contact/Il2dfRRqSNWA0EcfKuMIXoFs21FuVuw6v0TQi
            It's recommended to create a separate user with restricted rights and use this user for API calls.
